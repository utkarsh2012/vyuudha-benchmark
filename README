I have tried out:  
============
1. Serialized objects over Socket (IO)  
2. Protocol buffers over Socket (IO)  
3. JGroups  

Initial aim was to try out membership, but this can be extended to test data replication too.  

Notes: It's a basic stopclock benchmarking, I know it's lame, but it works!
